								<p>This purpose of this group project was to build models based on a dataset. The dataset my group chose featured the top 2000 movies rated on the online movie database, IMDb. We built three machine learning models from the data: a gradient boosting model, a random forest model, and a linear regression. Our ultimate goal was to select a model that our audience, Paramount Pictures, would be able to use to maximize its profitability and liklihood of higher IMDb ratings. We ulitmately selcted a linear regression model due to its interetability. Conclusions from our model suggest that Paramount should create movies that are categorized as drama or action and have a duration of around 150 minutes.  </p>

										<h2>Predicting NFL Most Valuable Player Attributes</h2>

								<p>This project was completed as part of my Database Management class. In this project, we were tasked with selecting a dataset to normalize, building a SQL database with the data, and performing several SQL queries on the data. The dataset my group selected was an NFL quarterbacks dataset that featured QB stats for the starting quarterback from all 32 NFL teams over 5 seasons (2018-2022). We were interested in answering how QB stats like rushing yards, passing yards, touchdowns, and interceptions impacted the success of the player and his team. With the results of our queries we built numerous data tables, graphs, and a webpage.  </p>

										<h2>Medical Health Cost Predictor</h2>
										<p>Fall 2022</p>
									</div>

								<p>In this project, my group used multi-linear regression to predict the largest impact on an indiviual's medical bills. The features of our model included the age of the indiviual, the individuals BMI, the number of children the individual has, and whether the individual smokes. Unsuprisingly, whether an individual smokes had by far the largest impact on the cost of their medical bills.  </p>
